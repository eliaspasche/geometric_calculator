## Project Structure

The entire application code is located in the `./app` folder. In addition to a folder for the classes respectively
types (`./app/types`)
and a folder for your own interface components (`./app/components`), there is a folder for each page of the
application (`./app/figures`, `./app/shapes`, `./app/imprint`).
The individual pages of the application are rooted via this folder structure. The respective folders of a page contain
the user interface implementation (`page.tsx`) of this page as well as a separate file for defining the layout (`layout.tsx`).
